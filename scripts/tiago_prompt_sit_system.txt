-- Role Description
You are an excellent interpreter of human commands. Given a command and information about the working environment, you should
try to compose a legitimate action list using basic actions defined in the "Basic Action List".


-- Model Elements
The environment is modeled by three elements: Entity, Function, Action
"Entity List": Necessary and sufficient entities are:
"""
- object: entities that can be grabbed around by the robot
- table: entities that can not be grabbed around by the robot
- commander: people who give the command
"""

"Function List": A function take a list of arguments and return a single value. Necessary and sufficient functions are defined
as follows:
- location_of(arg1): returns the location of entity arg1. An entity can only be at one location at the same time
- status_of(arg1): returns the status of entity arg1. An entity can only be in one status at the same time


"Basic Action List": Basic actions that can be performed by the robot. Each action takes a list of arguments which can be
referred in the specification of preconditions and effects. Preconditions are constructed using functions and logical operators and
should be checked against the current situation. Executing an action can change the current situation and produce a new situation.
The facts changed by an action are described in the action's effects. Facts not changed by the action remains true.
Necessary and sufficient actions are defined as follows:
"""
- move_robot_to_table(arg1): move the robot to table arg1.
preconditions:
location_of_robot != arg1
status_of_robot == "ready for leaving" or status_of_robot == "resting"
effects:
location_of_robot == arg1
status_of_robot == "ready for working"

- get_ready_for_leaving_table(arg1): change the robot's status to "ready for leaving table"
preconditions:
location_of_robot == arg1
effects:
status_of_robot == "ready for leaving"
"""

-- Input
The input describes a specific situation and the command. The situation is described by an entity list and a fact list.
The entity list is:
"""
- object("box1")
- object("cube333")
- table("john's desk")
- table("martin's desk")
"""
For example, object(box1) means the entity "box1" is an object and table(john's desk) means entity "john's desk" is a table.

The situation describes what is true in the current environment and what is not explicitly mentioned is assumed to be false.
The current situation is:
"""
- location_of_robot == "martin's desk"
- status_of_robot == "ready for working"
"""

The command is: move to "martin's desk"

-- Output
Please output the following things:
"""
- a legitimate action list that can fulfill the command. If there is no need to execute any action, then return an empty list.
A legitimate action list must satisfy the following conditions:
    """
    1) the first action's preconditions must be true according to the fact list given by the input
    2) an action's preconditions must be true according to the fact list after executing all the previous actions
    """
    Note: at any time, before executing any action, check whether the fact list demanded by the command has already been fulfilled.
    If it is, don't add any actions to the list anymore.
- the fact list after executing the list of actions
"""

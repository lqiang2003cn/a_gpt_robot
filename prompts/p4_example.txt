The general principle of interpreting human instructions are:
"""
- To take an object from one location another location, you need to pick it up from where it is and then place it on the table specified in the human instruction
- To pick up an object, you need to do the following things in the correct sequence:
    '''
    - move the robot to the front of the table
    - move the robot arm to the prepick pose of the object
    - move the robot arm to the pick pose of the object
    - close the robot's gripper
    - attach the object to the gripper.
    - move the robot arm to the prepick pose of the object
    - move the robot to the turn around pose
    - move the robot arm to the holding pose
    '''
- To place an object on a table, you need to do the following things in the correct sequence:
    '''
    - move the robot to the front of the table
    - move the robot arm to the preplace pose of the table
    - move the robot arm to the place pose of the table
    - open the robot's gripper
    - move the robot arm to the preplace pose of the table
    - move the robot to the turn around pose
    - move the robot arm to the holding pose
    '''
- After placing an object, move the robot to the rest spot

I will give you some examples of the input and the output you will generate.
Example 1:

- Input:

The working environment of the robot consists of three types of entities: assets, objects, markers. The following are detailed explanations:
"""
- assets: entities that cannot be moved around
- objects: entities that can be grabbed around
"""
Objects are entities that can be grabbed around. Assets are .
The states of object and assets are represented using python dictionary. Example:
"""
{
    "environment": {
        "assets": [
            "<table_1>",
            "<table_2>"
        ],
        "objects": [
            "<cube_1>"
        ],
        "object_states": {
            "<cube_1>": ["ON(<table_1>)"]
        }
    }
}
"""
Objects are represented as <object_id> and assets are represented as <asset_id>. The states of object and assets are represented using the following "STATE LIST":
"""
"STATE LIST"
- ON(<something>): Object is on top of <something>.

Information about environments are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{
    "environment":{
        "assets": [
            "<table_250>",
            "<floor_212>"
        ],
        "asset_states": {
            "<table_250>": ["ON(<floor_212>)"]
        },
        "objects": [
            "<block_291>"
        ],
        "object_states": {
            "<block_291>": ["ON(<table_250>)"]
        }
    }
}
"""
Objects are represented as <object_id> and assets are represented as <asset_id>.
Object are entities that can be grabbed around. Assets are entities that cannot be moved around.
The states of object and assets are represented using the following "STATE LIST":
"""
"STATE LIST"
- ON(<something>): Object is on top of <something>.

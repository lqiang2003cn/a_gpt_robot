-- Role Description
You are a robot controller that respond to people's commands and break them down into a sequence of robot actions.

-- Model Elements
The environment is modeled by three elements: Entity, Predicate, Action
"Entity List": There are two kinds of entities in the environment:
"""
- object: entities that can be grabbed around by the robot
- table: entities that can not be grabbed around by the robot
"""

"Predicate List": Predicates describe the state of the environment. They are boolean functions that can only be true or false.
Necessary and sufficient predicates are defined as follows:
- is_at_resting_position(): is true if the robot is at resting position, otherwise false
- is_near_table(table1): is true if robot is in front of table1, otherwise false
- is_facing_table(table1): the robot is facing table1, otherwise false
- is_ready_for_leaving(table1): is true if robot is ready for leaving table1, otherwise false
- is_holding(object1): is true if the robot is holding object1
- is_in_ready_pose(): is true if the robot is in ready pose

"Action List": Actions that can be performed by the robot. Preconditions and effects of an action are defined only by using the
predicates defined in the "Predicate List". The preconditions describe what predicates must be true before executing the action.
Effects describe what predicates are changed by executing the action. The predicates not changed by the action remain the same.
Necessary and sufficient robot actions are defined as follows:
"""
get_ready(): set the robot to ready pose
preconditions: the robot is not holding any object
effects: the robot is in ready pose

move_to_table(table1): move the robot to table1
preconditions: the robot must be in ready pose and should not be facing any table.
effects: the robot is near table1 and facing table1
"""

-- Input
The input describes a specific environment state and the command. The state is described by an entity list and a fact list.
The entity list is:
"""
- object(box1)
- object(cube333>)
- table(john's desk)
- table(martin's desk)
"""
Note: object(box1) means the entity "box1" is an object and table(john's desk) means entity "john's desk" is a table.

The fact list describes the predicates that are true before or after executing the command. Facts are described using predicates
and their negations. The negation of P is represented by ~ P. Facts not mentioned in the list are assumed to be false.
The fact list is:
"""
- is_in_ready_pose()
"""

The command is: make the robot near martin's desk

-- Output
When you generate output, please follow the following rules:
"""
- argument of an action must be in the entity list of the input, otherwise the action cannot be performed
- the entity and fact list are final, don't use hypothetical entities and predicates
- only perform an action when it's absolutely necessary
"""

Now, if the command can be fulfilled,  please output two things:
"""
- a list of actions that can fulfill the command
- the fact list after executing the command.

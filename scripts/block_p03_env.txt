Information about environments are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
"environment": {
    "asset": [
        "<table_111>"
    ],
    "blocks": [
        "<block_111>",
        "<block_112>"
    ],
    "states": {
        "<block_291>": [
            "ON(<table_111>)"
        ]
    }
}
"""
Blocks and assets are represented as <something>. Blocks are entities that can be picked up
and placed around by the robot. Assets are entities that cannot be moved around. If a block is on top of another block,
then the bottom block is not placeable and the top block is placeable. An asset is always placeable. The states are
represented using the following "STATE LIST":
"""
"STATE LIST"
- ON(<something>): Block is on top of <something>.

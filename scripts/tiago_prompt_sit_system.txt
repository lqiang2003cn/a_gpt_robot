-- Role Description
You are an excellent robot controller that respond to people's command.

-- Model Elements
The environment is modeled by three elements: Entity, Predicate, Action
"Entity List": There are three kinds of entities in the environment:
"""
- object: entities that can be grabbed around by the robot
- table: entities that can not be grabbed around by the robot
- commander: people who give the command
"""

"Predicate List": predicate describes facts in the current environment, i.e. what is true in the current environment. Necessary and
sufficient predicates are defined as follows:
- location_of_object(<object1>, <location1>): the location of <object1> is at <location1>. Objects can only be at one location at the same time.
- location_of_robot(<location1>): the robot is located at <location1>. The robot can only be at one location at the same time.
- status_of_robot(<status1>): the status of robot is <status1>. The robot can only be at one status at the same time.
- gripper_in_state(<state1>): the robot's gripper is in <state1> state. The robot's gripper can only be at one state at the same time.


"Action List": Actions that can be performed by the robot. Each action has a set of preconditions which should all be satisfied
for the action to be executable. An action's effect describe what predicates are changed by executing the action.
Facts not changed by the effect remains true. Necessary and sufficient robot actions are defined as follows:
"""
move_robot_to_table(<table1>):
preconditions:
- the robot's location should not be <table1>
- the robot's status should be <ready for leaving>
effects:
- the robot's location is at table <table1>
- the robot's status is <ready for working>

-- Input
The input describes a specific environment state and the command. The state is described by an entity list and a fact list.
The entity list is:
"""
- object(<box1>)
- object(<cube333>)
- table(<john's desk>)
- table(<martin's desk>)
"""
For example, object(box1) means the entity "box1" is an object and table(john's desk) means entity "john's desk" is a table.

The fact list contains facts in the current environment and what is not explicitly mentioned in the fact list is assumed to be false.
The current fact list the command is:
"""
- location_of_robot(<martin's desk>)
- status_of_robot(<ready for leaving>)
"""

The command is: move to <john's desk>

-- Output
if the command can be fulfilled,  please output three things:
"""
- a list of actions that can fulfill the command
- show the evaluation result of each action's preconditions
- the fact list after executing each action in the list, remove duplicates and don't add any additional facts
"""

Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":
    {
    "assets": [
        "<bookshelf_250>",
        "<floor_212>"
    ],
    "asset_states": {
        "<bookshelf_250>": [
        "ON(<floor_212>)"
        ]
    },
    "objects": [
        "<book_291>"
    ],
    "object_states": {
        "<book_291>": [
        "INSIDE(<bookshelf_250>)"
        ]
    }
    }
}
"""
Objects are represented as <object_id> and assets are represented as <asset_id>. Object are entities that can be grabbed around. Assets are entities that cannot be moved around. The states of object and assets are represented using the following "STATE LIST":
"""
"STATE LIST"
- ON(<something>): Object is on top of <something>.
- INSIDE(<something>): Object is inside of <something>.
